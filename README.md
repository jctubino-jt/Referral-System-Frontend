# Frontend of the Referral System made using React.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# The challenge/task

Develop a referrals feature using Laravel 8 and React. This feature is heavily inspired by Dropbox's referral https://www.dropbox.com/referrals so it would be a great reference for this task. For every successful referral (meaning you get a user to sign up using your referral link), you will get one point.

## Task Specifications

* Allow users to login and register
* Develop a new page `<domain>/referrals` to show a form where the user can input multiple emails to invite.
* This page should be written in react or should use a react component where the input is a multi-select _similar to dropbox_.
* Send an email notification to the invited email. The email's content doesn't have to be fancy, it can contain a simple instruction and link to the registration page with the referral link `<domain>/?refer=<code>`
* For each successful and new registrations with referral, increase the number of referrals count of the referrer.

## Notes
* Users who are invited already cannot be invited again.
* Existing users cannot be invited.
* A user can have a maximum of 10 successful referrals.

## Bonus Points
* Create a new page for an admin user `<domain>/admin/referrals` that shows the list of all the referrals made in the system. Columns can be referrer, email referred, date, status

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
